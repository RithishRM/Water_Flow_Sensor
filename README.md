Water Flow Monitoring System using ESP32
<br>
This project implements a real-time water flow and volume monitoring system using an ESP32 microcontroller and a flow sensor. The system calculates the flow rate (L/min) and total volume (L) of water based on sensor input and serves the data through a web interface accessible over WiFi.
<br>
Technologies Used:
<br>
1)ESP32 Microcontroller
<br>
2)Flow Sensor
<br>
3)WebServer Library for ESP32
<br>
4)HTML, JavaScript (AJAX) for the web interface (The Website can be made later according to the user)
<br>
5)WiFi for remote access
